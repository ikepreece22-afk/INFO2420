<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol> 

<li>What was your first impression of this site?</li> 
<li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li> 
<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li> 
<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
it? Why?</li> 
<li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
reasonable?</li> 
<li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li> 
<li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
navigation well done?</li> 
<li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
the pages?</li> 
<li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li> 
<li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>

<h2>Questions Answers</h2>

<li>To be honest, I wasn't super impressed with the website from trader joes. You know the 
    feeling of navigating a good website? A website I love it apple's product website. Something about it just feels super clean and smooth. 
    Trader Joes website seems to be suck in 2011. Seems a little old.</li>
<li>The flow of information appears to flow from top down, or a trickle down effect. 
    It makes scrolling just a little more enticing as you uncover the next factoid. 
    The website also almost always has text accompanying photos. </li>
<li>The stucture is only ok. From what I can tell there only appears to have one main header near the top of the page and 
    then the rest of the information seems to be floating loose. I think that a couple of more organizing headers would clean this website up a lot. </li>
<li>I think it the sites graphics are distracting. It takes my eyes elsewhere and not towards the key information in text.
     I do like the icons on the left side of the screen though. Those icons make navigation very easy if you're looking for those essential links. </li>
<li>Very quick load.</li>
<li>Some of the text was smaller than I'd like to see for the main page of their website. 
    Sizing up would improve readablility. I might be biased because my eyesight is worsening. 
    Next if some variation to text color could be added this would also improve readablility. </li>
<li>Yes I mentioned the navigation bar in my question 4 response but, I think it was done extreemly well.
    I like how it follows you and stays in one location as the user scrolls down. That feature makes it easy to use.</li>
<li>Their color scheme appears to be very on brand for Trader Joes. It takes no extra creative liberties, sticking to their brand recognition.</li>
<li>It does respond to the smaller window size. In my opinion, it looks better when in a smaller window. </li>
<li>The home page does a good job of highlighting other stories, inside the Trader Joes brand. Such as, their company podcast, food recalls, and anniversery.
    It offers diverse media and images that liven up the space. </li>
